## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The platform follows a clear separation of concerns, divided into frontend, backend, and a core document processing pipeline.

### Frontend Structure

*   **Next.js Application**: Serves as the web application framework, providing routing, API routes, and static asset serving.
*   **Component-Based UI**: Built with reusable React components (e.g., `Button`, `Layout`, `LoadingSpinner`) to ensure modularity and ease of development.
    *   **`MessageBubble`**: The core component for displaying chat messages. It intelligently renders different content types:
        *   Standard text and small tables using `ReactMarkdown` with `remark-gfm`.
        *   Large tables using a dedicated `VirtualizedTable` component for performance.
        *   Displays rich metadata like download buttons for modified tables.
    *   **`VirtualizedTable`**: A specialized component utilizing `react-window` to render large tabular data efficiently, ensuring smooth scrolling.
    *   **`DocumentToolbar`**: Handles interactive elements related to document viewing (e.g., zoom controls).
*   **State Management**: Utilizes `useChatStore` (Zustand) for global state management related to chat sessions, messages, and application-wide settings.
*   **API Client**: An `api.ts` utility (Axios-based) centralizes all frontend-to-backend communication.
*   **Styling**: Consistent and responsive styling achieved with Tailwind CSS.

### Backend Services

*   **FastAPI Application**: The core API layer that handles all incoming requests and routes them to appropriate services.
*   **`MultiChatService`**: The central service for all chat-related functionalities:
    *   Manages `ChatSession` and `ChatMessage` lifecycles.
    *   Integrates with LLMs for generating conversational responses and performing advanced analytical tasks.
    *   Handles **AI-driven table modifications**, parsing complex LLM outputs into structured data (summary, change log, modified table Markdown).
    *   Manages chat history and context for LLM interactions.
*   **`ContentExtractorService` (Conceptual)**: Responsible for the initial processing of uploaded documents:
    *   Parses document content into structured data models: `TextChunk`, `Table`, and `Image`.
    *   These extracted components are stored in MongoDB and serve as the analytical basis for the chat service.
*   **Database Models**: Uses Beanie to define models for `User`, `Document`, `TextChunk`, `Table`, `Image`, `ChatSession`, and `ChatMessage`, persisted in MongoDB.
*   **Authentication**: Secure user authentication handled via standard API practices.
*   **File Storage Integration**: Interacts with Cloudinary for robust storage and delivery of all document assets.
*   **Download Service**: An `EnhancedTableDownloadService` (or similar logic) in the API layer facilitates the export of modified tables into formats like Excel or Markdown.

### Document Processing Workflow

1.  **Upload**: Users upload documents (e.g., PDFs).
2.  **Extraction**: The `ContentExtractorService` processes the document, extracting:
    *   **Text Chunks**: Paragraphs, sentences, or other raw text units.
    *   **Tables**: Structured data identified within the document.
    *   **Images**: Visual elements detected.
3.  **Storage**: Extracted data is stored in MongoDB, linked to the original `Document` record.
4.  **Analysis**: This structured data (`TextChunk`, `Table`, `Image`) becomes the input for the `MultiChatService` and other analytical functions. Chat sessions can be initiated for a document as long as the document exists, regardless of the presence of specific content types.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   Python 3.9+
*   MongoDB instance (local or cloud-hosted)
*   Cloudinary Account (with API Key, API Secret, Cloud Name)
*   LLM Provider Account (e.g., OpenAI, Groq)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup**:
    ```
    cd backend # or the directory containing your FastAPI app
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in your backend root directory and configure environment variables (replace placeholders with your actual credentials):
    ```
    MONGO_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/your_db_name"
    CLOUD_NAME="your_cloudinary_cloud_name"
    API_KEY="your_cloudinary_api_key"
    API_SECRET="your_cloudinary_api_secret"
    LLM_API_KEY="your_llm_api_key"
    # Add any other environment variables as required by your specific LLM or services
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup**:
    ```
    cd frontend # or the directory containing your Next.js app
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```
    Create a `.env.local` file in your frontend root directory:
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8000" # Or your backend's URL
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend**:
    ```
    cd backend
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    (Adjust `main:app` if your FastAPI app is named differently)

2.  **Start the Frontend**:
    ```
    cd frontend
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

The application should now be accessible in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üí° Usage

1.  **Upload Documents**: Navigate to the document management section to upload your PDF files.
2.  **Start a Chat**: Select a document and choose to start either a "General Chat" or an "Analytical Chat" based on your needs.
3.  **Interact with AI**: Type your questions or commands in natural language.
4.  **Modify Tables**: Ask the AI to make specific changes to tables, like "change the CGPA for 2027 to 10".
5.  **Download Results**: If a table is modified, a download button will appear, allowing you to export the modified table as an Excel file.
